1. Ask the user to do sudo apt install or check if python3 is already installed
2. If at all , .venv/bin/pip doesnâ€™t exist -  rm -rf .venv
sudo apt install python3-venv -y  # ensure it's installed
python3 -m venv .venv
3. if vs code already installed and not done through the flow , make sure to recognise that
4.look where the tmp folder is generated and is it necessary if so think of an alternative
5.Now we have to add in liberty files one by one , seems like yosys has nothing to remember what was chosen already (.lib file) 
6.in .local - verilator or tools , nextpnr are seperate whereas openroad seems to be inside bin directory ! (look if this is okay or clean it up )
